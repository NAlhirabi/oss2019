## Description of session

description  : The purpose of this session is to introduce the project and create a rough roadmap of deliverables for the project for the summit. The project is currently a documentation project but is lacking documentation, one of the key objectives of the week will be to produce documentation.


## Outcomes/Deliverables 
- Set Objectives for the track for the summit
- Spoke on project structure (there are a number of sub-projects that are being set up as separate projects e.g. Threat Model cookbooks), a question was put out to the group on whether the separate projects was acceptable, the group like the idea of autonomy of such a format but that if they differ in ownership they should be all in 'one place' to allow for easy access for consumers. 
- Discussed upcoming sessions and how they meet the intent of the project (get stuff documented) and (if relevant) how they link to other OWASP projects.
- Discussed that there is a cross-over of other OWASP projects and how some upcoming sessions will cover that cross over and collaboration. e.g. Automated Threat Handbook and Cloud Security Project.
- List of submodules we want to see in the OWASP project created.


## Synopsis and Takeaways (recommend)

- Creation of a list of sub- projects with ownership 



### OWASP TM Project Modules

Some of the below items may be able to be combined under existing / new sub-modules.

- Examples (TM Cookbook)
- Attack/ Mitigation Library
- TM Methodologies
- TM Frameworks
- Education - OWASP Training
- Academia - Research papers
- Practical tips
  - versioning
  - Inheritance
- implementation tips/ tricks (agile vs waterflow tips etc)
- Cheat Sheets (existing)
- meta definition for threat models (DSL workshop thur)
- tools -> Questionnaire (to add tools and tool info - G-questionnaire?)
  - description
  - what meth. framework do they implement
  - meta data on tools / tool categorisation (which of the 4 TM questions does the tool answer)
- Case studies (from varius experiences on threat modeling in different environments - covering both successes and failures)
- Glossary / taxonomy


## Identified Questions

- Who are the customers of the Threat Model projects?
- What is the project structure?
- Should there be separate projects or sub-project modules? 
- How is ownership defined for the various threat model projects?
- Is anyone looking at creating a new threat modeling tool? 
- Should we perform a call for TM data (Top 10 style?)
- Should we threat model the DevSlop CI/CD pipeline using different frameworks to compare? 
- Should we update the Juice Shop threat model (either re-do or call out the version that was threat modelled)?
- Why aren't more people contributing to the project? How do we make it frictionless?
- Is the project outline on the OWASP website accurate still?

## Follow up

- Define owners for each module suggested and ensure the owners are set up with wiki access.
